# NgrxTodoPractice

This is a project for me to practice angular and angular-redux. Following main dependencies are used in this project:
* [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) Predictable state container for Javascript.
* [@angular-redux/store](https://github.com/angular-redux/store) Redux + Angular bindings
* [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) Simple “selector” library for Redux
* [Redux DevTools Chrome Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
<br/>And<br/>
* [Semantic-ui](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI)
for styling

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.0.

## How to use
Run `yarn` or `npm install` at root to install all the dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
